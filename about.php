				<h1>ABOUT THE STUDIO</h1>
				<p>Cloak and Dagger opened it's doors in 2011 hoping to have an impact on the local tattoo industry in Dayton, OH. We are attempting to break the mold of the typical tattoo experience &mdash; where an artist's ego can sometimes outweigh the client's vision. Our artists strive to produce high end tattoos that live up to the standards of our most important critics &mdash; our customers.</p>
				<p>While we do have some flash to choose from, we have artists who excel in a variety of different styles who will draw a custom tattoo specifically for you.</p>
				<p>Located in the heart of Dayton, Ohio near UD campus, our studio contains 5 tattoo stations as well as a private tattoo and piercing booth. Call 937.222.7880 to set up an appointment time, or stop in and visit with an available artist.</p>
