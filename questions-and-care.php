				<h2>WHAT'S THE SHOP MINIMUM FOR A TATTOO <span>/</span></h2>
				<p>The shop minimum for a tattoo is $50.00.  This usually covers small script and tattoos no larger than 2 inches.</p>
				<h2>HOW LONG OF A SESSION CAN I SCHEDULE <span>/</span></h2>
				<p>For larger tattoos, we will schedule an 8-9 hour session with a lunch break.</p>
				<h2>HOW DO YOU HANDLE STERILIZATION <span>/</span></h2>
				<p>Our needles are pre-sterilized single-use. We use disposable tubes or stainless steel tubes that are sterilized in a Ritter M11 Autoclave after every client.  A cold sterilant is used on machines, clip cords, and work surfaces along with barrier film.</p>
				<h2>WHAT DO I NEED TO BRING TO MY FIRST APPOINTMENT<span>/</span></h2>
				<p>State-issued photo ID, reference material for the artist to draw from if applicable. Be sure to bring a change of clothing, or wear clothing that allows easy access to the area getting tattooed.  For instance, if you are getting a thigh tattoo bring or wear a pair of loose fitting shorts.</p>
				<h2>HOW DO I PAY FOR MY SESSION <span>/</span></h2>
				<p>We accept cash or credit.</p>
				<h2>HOW DO I CARE FOR MY TATTOO <span>/</span></h2>
				<p>After your tattoo session, be sure to remove any bandages and wash it when you get home. Apply a small amount of Aquaphor ointment a couple of times a day for about a week, and then switch to a white water based lotion.  Something for sensitive skin with no fragrances and a low alcohol content.<br /><br />For more care instructions <a href="">download or tattoo aftercare brochure</a> or call the shop.</p>
				<h2>HOW DO I CARE FOR MY PIERCING <span>/</span></h2>
				<p>Wash your piercing once or twice daily. Use a saline solution to rinse after washing and a couple of times throughout the day.  There is no need to turn your jewelry. It's best to avoid touching the piercing unless you are cleaning it.<br /><br />For more care instructions <a href="">download or piercing aftercare brochure</a> or call the shop.</p>
